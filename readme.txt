Recreated web game using html+css+js.

Basically, you have:
![main-page](./screenshots/main page.png)
3 buttons, which alows you to move to different locations.
locations are: 
-store;
-cave;
-dragon cave;

actions:
![store](./screenshots/store page.png)
-buy weapon;
-buy health;
-sell weapon;

![cave](./screenshots/cave.png)
-attack;
-dodge attack;
-return to town;

![dragon](./screenshots/dragon.png)
also, there is one mini-game, which is left as an easter egg.

Applied many functions and relearned more about js.
Took 6-7 hours, but it was worth it.
